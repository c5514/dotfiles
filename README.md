# NixOS setup
* Neovim is configured using Nixvim flake.  It is made to edit TeX files, other languages only have a minimal setup.
* I am using awesomeWM(still in process) and sway. Gnome is just there because sometimes I like to use it.
> [!WARNING]
> While I am learning Fabric to make widgets Hyprland will not be updated.
